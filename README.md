💻 Vishnu R – Junior Full Stack Web Developer Portfolio
Hello! I’m Vishnu R, a passionate and curious Junior Full Stack Web Developer with a growing interest in building clean, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. This repository contains my personal portfolio, which consists of two simple but effective pages showcasing my current skills, background, and projects.

🌟 About the Portfolio
This portfolio is designed as a basic yet professional introduction to who I am and what I can do. As someone at the beginning of my journey in web development, I’ve focused on using clean code, simple structure, and responsive design to present my capabilities.

The two pages include:

1️⃣ Home Page
This page gives an overview of who I am, what technologies I work with, and what I’m passionate about. It’s styled using HTML and CSS, with basic layout techniques and responsive design principles. I’ve kept the interface clean and easy to navigate so that visitors can quickly understand my profile.

2️⃣ Projects & Contact Page
This second page contains a brief selection of sample or practice projects that I’ve worked on, along with links (if hosted), project titles, and short descriptions. There’s also a contact section where visitors can find my email address to get in touch. This demonstrates how I structure content and organize pages.
